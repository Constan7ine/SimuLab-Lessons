# SimuLab lesson code

Online code repository of simulab workshops held in the National University of Ireland. It's intended to be sample code for ramping up lesson difficulty from very basic to large social and economic simulations. 

Most of the code either requires no dependencies, or things you'd find in Anaconda, like numpy, matplotlib etc. 

All code is written by me.
